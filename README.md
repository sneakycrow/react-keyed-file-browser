# react-keyed-file-browser

I forked this originally from [uptick/react-keyed-file-browser](https://github.com/uptick/react-keyed-file-browser). It wasn't actively being updated anymore, and I found the original package useful but outdated and hard to modify. I forked it with the intent of my own personal use.
